# 🧠 Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Deep Learning

### 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my **Valise Technologies Internship (Python Developer)**.  
It implements an **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** system using **EasyOCR**, a deep learning–based text detection and recognition framework built on PyTorch.

---

### 🎯 Objective
To build a simple Python-based system capable of detecting and extracting text from images — both **printed and handwritten** — using Deep Learning.

---

### 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python  
- EasyOCR  
- OpenCV  
- Matplotlib  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

### 🚀 Steps to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Optical-Character-Recognition-DL.git
   cd Optical-Character-Recognition-DL
2.	Open the OCR_Project.ipynb notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3.	Run all cells — the notebook will:
	•	Install dependencies
	•	Load the test image
	•	Perform OCR
	•	Display the detected text and bounding boxes
	•	Save results to extracted_text.txt
📊 Results
	•	Successfully detected and extracted text from printed and handwritten images.
	•	Achieved consistent accuracy with EasyOCR’s pre-trained deep learning model.
	•	Performance may vary slightly depending on image clarity, font, and lighting.

This project demonstrates the development of a Deep Learning–based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system using Python and EasyOCR.
It forms a foundation for future real-world applications like document scanning, invoice parsing, and handwritten note transcription.
